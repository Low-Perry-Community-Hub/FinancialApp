# FinancialApp
A modular financial app built using the Database-Agent-LLM pattern. Fetches crypto and stock data, integrates Web3, and provides AI-driven analysis

# FinancialApp: Database-Agent-LLM Pattern

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build modular applications using the **Database-Agent-LLM** pattern. The app:
- Fetches financial and crypto data from APIs like Binance and Tiingo.
- Integrates with Web3 for blockchain interactions (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon).
- Uses an LLM to analyze data and answer user queries.

## Key Components
1. **Database**: Stores crypto and stock data (SQLite for now; scalable to PostgreSQL or DynamoDB).
2. **Agents**: Fetch, clean, and process data from APIs and blockchains.
3. **LLM**: Provides intelligent analysis and natural language responses.

## Tech Stack
- **Database**: SQLite (local) and PostgreSQL (optional).
- **Agents**: Python scripts for API and database interactions.
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT (can be swapped with local models like LLaMA2).
- **API**: FastAPI for exposing endpoints.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourOrgName/FinancialApp.git
   cd FinancialApp

   Why This Is Better
Streamlined Focus: Focuses only on connecting the LLM, database, and agents.
Modularity: Each component (database, agent, LLM) is independent and replaceable.
Scalability: Can easily switch to cloud services (e.g., AWS DynamoDB, RDS) or local alternatives.
Efficiency: Avoids unnecessary complexity, letting you focus on building functionality.
